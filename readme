#INTRODUCTION

DeepCCon, DeepRCon and DeepConPred have been tested successfully on the 64-bit ubuntu linux system.

#REQUIREMENT
(1) gcc and g++ compilers;
(2) python and matlab programs;

Here, the file "train_examples.fa" and "test_examples.fa" are just the examples.

DeepCCon:
(1)Please prepare the required feature files in the "./DeepCCon/train_data/" and "./DeepCCon/test_data/" sub-folders, according to the examples in this sub-folders;
(2)Please change directory to the "./DeepCCon/codes/" sub-folder, the features can be extracted by running "python extract_train_features.py ../../train_examples.fa" and "python extract_test_features.py ../../test_examples.fa", respectively;
(3)Please change directory to the "./DeepCCon/DBN/" sub-folder, the DBN model can be trained and tested by running "matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -r main".

DeepRCon:
(1)Please prepare the required feature files in the "./DeepRCon/train_data/" and "./DeepRCon/test_data/" sub-folders, according to the examples in this sub-folders;
(2)Please change directory to the "./DeepRCon/codes/" sub-folder, the features can be extracted by running "python extract_train_features.py ../../train_examples.fa" and "python extract_test_features.py ../../test_examples.fa", respectively;
(3)Please change directory to the "./DeepRCon/DBN/" sub-folder, the DBN model can be trained and tested by running "matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -r main".

DeepConPred:
(1)Please prepare the required feature files in the "./DeepConPred/train_data/" and "./DeepConPred/test_data/" sub-folders, according to the examples in this sub-folders;
(2)Please change directory to the "./DeepConPred/codes/" sub-folder, the features can be extracted by running "python extract_train_features.py ../../train_examples.fa" and "python extract_test_features.py ../../test_examples.fa", respectively;
(3)Please change directory to the "./DeepConPred/DBN/" sub-folder, the DBN model can be trained and tested by running "matlab -nosplash -nodesktop -r main".


These three software packages will be further updated for better performance and convenient usage.
